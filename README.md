# CleanDataProject

## The script 
There is a single script called "run_analysis.R".
The script is in the root of the repository.

### Executing the script

In order to run the script start by running R.

The premise is that the data are present (uncompressed) in a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" in the root of the local git repository folder.

Then follow these steps: 

* Set the work directory to the root of the local (git) repository  for this project.
* Type this in the R prompt: source("./run_analysis.R")
* The output is called "output.txt" and it will be in the root of the local git repository.
